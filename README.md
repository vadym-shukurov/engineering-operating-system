# 🛡️ Service Ownership & Platform Governance

> **High-trust, high-autonomy engineering starts here.** > This repository contains the governance frameworks used to manage 10+ squads and 50+ engineers, shifting from a "Gatekeeper" model to a decentralized **"You Build It, You Own It"** philosophy.

## 🎯 The Mission
The goal of this framework is to empower autonomous "mini-startups" within the organization while maintaining elite engineering standards. By defining a clear "Paved Road," we enable teams to release at high velocity without compromising system reliability.

## 🏛️ Core Frameworks

### 📄 [Service Ownership Charter](./service-ownership-model.md)
The foundational contract defining the responsibilities between Platform and Product teams.
* **Maturity Model:** Tracking squad evolution from Reactive to Strategic.
* **Responsibility Matrix:** Clear ownership boundaries for Design, Dev, Deploy, and Operate phases.
* **Definition of Done:** Strict quality gates including 85% test coverage and AI-assisted reviews.

### 🧪 Modern Quality Practices
Detailed execution guides for shifting quality to the left:
* **Test Pyramid Strategy:** Balancing unit, API, and UI automation for maximum feedback speed.
* **Exploratory Testing Charters:** Human-centric sessions to complement automated suites.
* **AI-Assisted Guardrails:** Implementing automated logic and security analysis in the CI pipeline.

## 📈 Impact on DORA Metrics
This framework is designed to drive measurable business outcomes:
* **Velocity:** Small-batch delivery supporting 2-week (or faster) heartbeat.
* **Reliability:** 20% YoY reduction in production incidents through ownership.
* **Maintenance:** Maintaining code duplication below 1.7% and zero critical vulnerabilities.

## 🧠 Philosophy: "You Build It, You Own It, You Love It"
1. **Autonomy with Accountability:** Freedom to choose, responsibility for results.
2. **The Paved Road:** Make the right way the easy way through superior internal tooling.
3. **Blameless Culture:** Every incident is a systems-improvement opportunity.
